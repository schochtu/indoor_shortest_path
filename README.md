# Shortest Path

This application was developed as part of the course "Mathematical Modeling" by Dr. Rockefeller from the University of Koblenz-Landau, Germany.
The task was to determine the shortest path indoors by means of a graph. The application was written using python and the A* and Jump Point Search algorithms were used to solve the problem.
